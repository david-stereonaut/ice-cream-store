    aboutShort: 'A perfect blend of Vanilla and Delight',
    about: 'In the middle ages, a lot of different delights were banned, among them the delight of the vanilla. Sadly all of the recipes dated before the middle ages are gone... or are they? Here in goodstock ice cream we use a secret recipe which was handed down from father to child since humans were able to write. And with that recipe, we know that our Vanilla Delight ice cream is more than an ice cream, its a piece of history.',

    aboutShort: 'The first ice cream that has Chocolate!',
    about: `One might find himself asking - 'Why would they describe the taste of an ice cream with words such as panic?'. The reason for that is the unique combination of tastes which we have shoved together into one ice cream, which has caused panic, hallucinations and in rare cases even death, among certain ill-behaved pinguins that are definetly free and not kept in our basement.`,

    aboutShort: 'Is it honey? Is it burnt? Yes it is!',
    about: `This ice cream was originally developed in a research on bees, and has been changing the face of the earth quite literally since. Did you know that there is a special kind of bee that lives underground and burns the honey it steals from other bees? Well, there hasn't been until someone accidently created them in a lab in Cambridge 7 years ago! And guess what happens to the honey after this bee abomination burns it - That's right! It turns into an ice cream.`,

    aboutShort: `We'll never tell you which fruits!`,
    about: `While it may lack the romance of fresh-from-the-farmers-market produce, freeze-dried fruit is second to none for making a vibrantly colored, ultra-fruity no-churn ice cream. Because it contains zero moisture, freeze-dried fruit can be ground into a fine powder that dissolves readily in the base, lending a more concentrated dose of flavor and color than fresh fruit could achieve, along with a creamier consistency.`,

    about: `I came across it a few Christmas ago. We tend to have extremely quiet holidays or ridiculously boisterous, large ones. In one of the latter, we were about forty persons and my cousin's sister-in-law had made her famous strawberry ice cream. It was a very large batch - we all chip in with food and bring so much more than we need, we could feed an army, literally - and I was eager to try the much talked about ice cream, which she originally made with homegrown raspberries. It didn't disappoint! It was amazing and so incredibly easy to make.`,
